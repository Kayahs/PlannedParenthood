        <h3>Corporate Funders: Invest Strategically in PPT</h3>
        <p>
          As a corporate funder, you have philanthropic goals and priorities to meet your strategic branding, 
          imaging and visibility needs. We offer a wide range of opportunities to sponsor programs, services, 
          events, and activities that align with your brand and values.
          <br><br>
          We believe that everyone should have the right to make informed choices about their sexual health.
          We’ve been working tirelessly for more than 50 years to protect and promote that right – because, for all
          of the strides we’ve made, sexual and reproductive health rights continue to be undermined. How are we
          closing the gap? We harness the power of technology to serve the needs of youth in relevant and
          innovative ways. We conduct research to develop programming and services that serve underserved
          communities. We give youth a voice. We amplify voices that might otherwise be silenced. We invite you to
          add your voice to ours.
          <br><br>
          When you partner with PPT, you do so much more than underwrite our programs and services. You invest
          in the direct and meaningful impact they have on the people and communities of Toronto.
        </p>

        <h3>
          Granting Funders, Government and City: Give Your
          <br>
          Community a Voice – Partner with PPT
        </h3>
        <p>
          As a funder, you are passionate about solving social issues that affect your community. So are we. At
          PPT, we believe that everyone should have the right to make informed choices about their sexual health.
          We’ve been working tirelessly for more than 50 years to protect and promote that right – because, for all
          of the strides we’ve made, sexual and reproductive health rights continue to be undermined. How are we
          closing the gap? We harness the power of technology to serve the needs of youth in relevant and
          innovative ways. We conduct research to develop programming and services that serve underserved
          communities. We give youth a voice. We amplify voices that might otherwise be silenced. We invite you to
          add your voice to ours. 
          <br><br>
          When you partner with PPT, that’s exactly what you get – a partner. We work collaboratively with our
          funders to create positive change in our community. We work hard, every day, to earn the trust of the
          youth who use our services and participate in our programs. We’ll work every bit as hard to earn yours.
          We’re accredited, soundly structured, and have a long history of working with funders to deliver on
          objectives, and meet targets. We’re realistic about both. Of course, that alone isn’t what makes us a
          smart investment. What does is our unwavering accountability – not only to you as our partner, but to the
          youth we serve.
